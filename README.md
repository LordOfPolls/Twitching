# Twitching
A twitch notification discord bot utilising Slash Commands

This bot was origionally created for the 404SMP Discord Server to provide notifications when the participants went live on Twitch 

## Features
- Notifications when a streamer goes live 
- Archiving of notifications when the streamer goes offline 
- Posting a list of streamers for a twitch links channel (more asthetically pleasing thatn default discord-twitch embeds)
- Embed colours are matched to the dominant colour of the streamers profile picture 
- Cache-breaking stream thumbnail in embeds (prevents the same thumbnail appearing for all streams)
- Only users with manage-messages or higher can add streamers to the servers tracked list
- Per-server streamer lists

## Can I use this?
The easier option is to just add the bot, but this bot is not intended (or capable) of being a large scale bot. Should this bot grow to large, i will disable adding it
